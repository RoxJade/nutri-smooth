# Nutri-Smooth

[Visit Nutri-Smooth here](insert website url)

The aim of the Nutri-Smooth site is to encourage users to share a range of healthy, nutritious and tasty smoothie recipes. The site showcases a selection of smoothie recipe's, breaking down ingredients and macro-nutrients for each. 
Nutri-Smooth is a web application allowing users to create, read, update and delete their own smoothie recipes. It also allows users to search for recipes.
Nutri-Smooth has been created using a variety of languages including HTML, CSS and Python and uses MongoDB to store data.
